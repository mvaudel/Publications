> _In this manuscript, we describe a bioinformatic tool that can build biological networks of different levels of granularity using the [Reactome](reactome.org) pathway database, and map different types of omics data to it. Notably, it can build a network to the level of [proteoforms](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2369), where genes and proteins are separated according to their post-translational state. Hence, interactions are more specific, and interactions between different forms of the same proteins become visible as connections between different nodes, thus providing a new dimension to study biological networks._
