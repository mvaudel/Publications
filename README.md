> _In this manuscript, we describe a bioinformatic tool that can build biological networks of different levels of granularity using the [Reactome](reactome.org) pathway database, and map different types of omics data to it. Notably, it can build a network to the level of [proteoforms](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2369), where genes and proteins are separated according to their post-translational state. Hence, interactions are more specific, and interactions between different forms of the same proteins become visible as connections between different nodes, thus providing a new dimension to study biological networks. This manuscript is the first output of a project initiated with the Reactome team in 2013, it took an incredible amount of work to complete._

> _The association between genetic variation and phenotypes, _e.g._ with the Body Mass Index (BMI), is often presented as static, yet it changes over the course of life. Here we present-genome wide association results during the first years of life, from birth to age 8, making possibly one of the first genetic time lapse. It represents 12 GWASs on the [MoBa cohort](https://www.fhi.no/studier/moba/forskere/sporreskjemaer---mor-og-barn-unders/), for which we buit a complete bioinformatic environment from scratch._
